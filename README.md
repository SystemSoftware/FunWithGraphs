# FunWithGraphs

Basic algorithms as part of the lecture on socio-technical information systems. In this Java program:

- a simple representation for a graph based on HashMap and HashSet is shown,
- a factory method for the creation of a random graph is implemented,
- a function to compute the clustering coefficient is - not yet - given, and
- a factory method to create graphs with higher clustering coefficient according to the preferential attachment rules introduced by Barab√°si and Albert is shown

The program still lacks good structure (currently, the factory methods can access the implementation details of the underlying graph implementation; something considered as a bug and
not as a feature) and the computation for the clustering coefficient is still missing.
